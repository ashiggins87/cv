        <p><em>Senior Veterinary Assistant at <strong><a href="https://www.steinervet.com/">The Animal Hospital at Steiner Ranch</a></strong>.</em></p>
        <p>I am a Veterinary Assistant of 9 years who is looking to make a career change into Web Development. I grew up in Las Vegas, NV then moved to College Station, TX where I completed high school and college at Texas A&M University. Aftewards,
          I
          lived
          abroad in Thailand and wanted to put my degree in Animal Science to use as an assistant an <a href="https://www.maetaengelephantpark.com/clinic/">elephant veterinarian</a>. Since then, I have worked in veterinary medicine only to find
          there's not
          much professional growth left for me. I have always been
          creative and systematic. I am resourceful and like to know how things work, and how to fix them. I like to examine the "why's" of things in everything I do, like picking apart the storyline in a movie or understanding how to make that new
          crochet
          knot. I believe my skills that have made me an excellent veterinary assistant and overall worker will be useful in the web development field.</p>
